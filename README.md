A collection of my data science projects

## [Yahoo Finance Project](https://www.google.com/)
This project was executed on behalf of Company ABC Inc. The goal of this project was to scrape data from the Yahoo Finance page,
wrangle the data so as to be able to perform DataFrame filtering and sorting.
* **Python** was the language used for the project
* **Requests** library was used to get data from the website
* **BeautifulSoup** was used to format the data and extract relevant content for the data wrangling step
* **Pandas** was the library used to store the extracted data into dataframes
* **Google Colab** was the environment used for implementing the project

Through this project, the client is able to keep track of active stocks so as to guide their decision-making process.
